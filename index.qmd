## Bio

Hello! I am a PhD student from Brazil and since 2023 I have been working with diagnostic tools for tuberculosis detection within Brazilian prison units, overseeing data management and practicing as a medical doctor in the care of people deprived of liberty. Other then current academic work, I have experience in clinical research practice and care to Indigenous populations, riverside communities in the Pantanal region, as well as outpatient and hospital care as an infectious disease specialist.

In my spare time I love to take care of my pet rats, plants and watch horror movies.
